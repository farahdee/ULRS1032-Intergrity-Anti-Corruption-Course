## Reflection
Through this course, I gained a deeper understanding of why ethics, honesty, and integrity matter in personal and working life. I learned how corruption can negatively impact society, economic development, and trust within organizations. By studying real cases and participating in discussions, I became more aware of the laws and initiatives introduced by Malaysia to prevent corruption. In my opinion, using more practical activities such as case studies and role-playing exercises, like the videos we created earlier, would make learning about integrity more meaningful. Overall, this course taught me that true success is not based solely on knowledge or skills, but also on consistently upholding strong moral values and ethical behavior in everything we do.

## Introduction
This assignment required us to apply what we learned through creative and practical activities. For this task, we produced a short video that highlighted an example of corruption in a marathon running event. In addition, we designed a poster related to corruption in sports, using data collected through a Google Form survey.
The purpose of these activities was to help us better understand how corruption can occur in real-life situations and how integrity plays an important role in ensuring fairness and trust, especially in sports. By working on both the video and the poster, we were able to explore the topic in a more interactive and meaningful way.

## Summmary
The video project focused on corruption in a marathon run, showing how dishonest actions can affect fair competition and damage the spirit of sportsmanship. Meanwhile, the poster project presented information on corruption in sports using data collected from a Google Form, which helped support our message with real responses and statistics.
By combining visual storytelling and data analysis, we were able to communicate the impact of corruption more clearly. These activities helped us connect theoretical concepts of integrity and anti-corruption to real-world examples.

## Reflection
Through this assignment, I gained a deeper understanding of how corruption can happen even in areas that are meant to promote fairness, such as sports. Creating the video made me realize how small unethical actions can lead to unfair outcomes and loss of trust. Designing the poster using survey data also helped me understand public awareness and opinions about corruption in sports.
This experience improved my teamwork, creativity, and communication skills. Most importantly, it reinforced the importance of integrity and honesty in all aspects of life. The assignment showed me that promoting anti-corruption is not just about laws and rules, but also about raising awareness and encouraging ethical behavior among individuals.
